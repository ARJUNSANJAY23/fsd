	<h1>WALKED IN THE WAY OF SUCCESS</h1>
	<P>Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.[89] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007.
    He was also elected as the captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007 after seniors players like Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble refused to be part of T20 format. India won the first ever ICC World Twenty20 Tournament by defeating Pakistan in Final making India's first solo ICC Trophy Win since 1983. The world cup win saw Dhoni as future captain of Indian cricket team in all formats.
    On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one.
    In 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years. In the three-match ODI series, Dhoni top-scored for India in all three innings; however, India lost the series 1–2. In the first ODI at Chennai, he helped India recover from 29/5 to help post a total of 227 in 50 overs. Scoring 113 not out, he had a record partnership with Ravichandran Ashwin, although India had lost .[95]
    Winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Dhoni became the first and the only captain in international cricket to claim all ICC trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, he was out for a duck and ended the tournament with 27 runs from two innings. However, Dhoni's field placements and tactics were to India's advantage, as the team had beat the opposition by five runs (D/L method).[96] He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[97]
    Just after the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation tournament against West Indies and Sri Lanka.[98] Dhoni had gotten injured at the start of the tournament itself and got ruled out for the whole tournament. However, despite not having fully recovered, he returned to play the final against Sri Lanka, once again only to find himself become a hero after single-handedly taking India to a victory by one wicket. Dhoni scored an unbeaten 45 off 52 balls while scoring 16 runs in the final over required for the victory. He was adjudged Man of the match for this performance.[99]
    In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more ODI-runs against Australia.[100]

	<H1> AS A CSKIAN </H1>
	Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions.[146] Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and the 2023 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles and ended up as a runner-up in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2019 IPL league seasons.[147][148]

MS Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for Super Kings. Dhoni is at the top of the list of most matches played in the Indian Premier League.[149] Dhoni is also one of the three captains to have won the Indian Premier League twice, with CSK.[150] Dhoni is the only captain in the IPL to win more than 100 matches. He is also the most successful wicket-keeper with 180 dismissals as of IPL 2023.

In 2015, the Chennai Super Kings got banned from the IPL for 2 years by R.M. Lodha from the committee of Supreme Court of India.[151] They were banned due to the illegal betting of one of their officials, Gurunath Meiyappan.[152] He was arrested with charges of spot-fixing[153] According to Dhoni, it was darkest period of his career. He said "The biggest crime that I can commit is not a murder, it is actually match-fixing".[154][155]

In 2016, Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), a debuting IPL franchise team made him captain but after the poor performance of the team in that season they removed Dhoni from the captain's position and chose Steve Smith, then Australian national team captain, for the post. Dhoni played as wicketkeeper batsman in the 2017 season for RPS.[156]

In the 2018 IPL season, CSK returned to IPL, and he was again appointed to lead the franchise by the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in that season and led his side to their third IPL title.[157]

In the 2020 & 2021 seasons of the IPL, Dhoni failed to perform where he scored 200 runs in 14 innings in 2020 and 116 runs in 16 innings with an average of 15.29 in the 2021 IPL season.[23]

He led the franchise to the 4th title in 2021 Indian Premier League season. Dhoni got retained by CSK for ₹12 Cr, before IPL 2022 player's auction.[158] He stepped down from captaincy on 24 March 2022, where Ravindra Jadeja became the new captain.[159][160] However, on 30 April 2022, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni.[161]

	<H4>PASSION TO WORK THE NATION</H4>
	<P>

The captain of two World Cup-winning teams, an honorary lieutenant colonel with the Indian Territorial Army, and a qualified paratrooper!

Cricket icon Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s CV, if you may, stands apart.

Just like his love for the game, Dhoni has an enduring association with the Indian Armed Forces.

In 2015, four years after he was awarded the honorary rank in the Indian Territorial Army, he became a qualified paratrooper after completing five parachute training jumps from Indian Army aircraft in the Agra training camp.
